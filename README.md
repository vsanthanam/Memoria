# Memoria

Memoria is memory testing application for macOS. It uses the thoroughly test x86 cli memtest, and based on Kelly Computing's [rember](http://www.kelleycomputing.net/rember/) app.

Memoria is designed for the modern macOS runtime environment, and is built to be light-weight and easy to use for people not comfortable with using memtest directly.
