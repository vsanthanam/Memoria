# Memoria

Memoria is memory testing application for macOS. It uses the thoroughly tested x86 cli memtest, and is roughly based on Kelly Computing's [rember](http://www.kelleycomputing.net/rember/) app.

Memoria is designed for the modern macOS runtime environment, and is built to be light-weight and easy to use for people not comfortable with using memtest directly.

## Requirements

* macOS 10.13.x+ (Support for older versions coming soon)

## Features

* Easy to use GUI for memtest with human readable console
* Fullly verbose logs so you can see memtest's CLI outout
* Apple Universal Logging w/ Console.app Support
* Notification Center Support
* Touch Bar Support
